      section2: "Allow me propose a thesis, that all is mathematics. That all is an answer to two questions; Who am I? and Am I alone? Questions brought about by the realization of self. And that life has no general meaning, only the meaning the beholder inflicts upon himself. And so the universe was born in an effort to answer this questions, unknowingly unleashing all possible possibilities of what the answer could be. Or dare I say, only one possibility of what the answer could be. For there is an answer to every question. And since who I am is not similar to who you are, then duality is born, else we are one. And so we have it. All is an answer to two questions; Who am I? And am I alone? And the answer to each is one side of duality",

What does this mean? It means that we can attach meaning to different homophones.And that the individual meanings of these homophones would make up the meaning the entire word",
      section2: "Let us look at an example. In the context of the word book, we can derive three sounds; b , u and k. The meaning of each would thus make up the meaning of book. This would imply that the words see and sea have very high correlation in terms of their root meaning. If this hypothesis is correct. It would imply that indeed there are no coincidences, and are everything we do conforms to a certain pattern and way of expression.",

It is part of our enterprise growth research bundle, where we explore the possibility of integrating an intelligent system into the company workflow. Numerous benefits come along when this is done. From customer support to admin assistants, our mission is to ensure you not only grow, but grow intelligently",

Well, thats a tough one. ",

However, I believe that the mind and the soul are the same. Efforts to differentiate the two have grown futile. Our spiritual brothers and sisters will not be pleased, but science has spoken. And yes, if a computer system were to store, process, and retrieve information continuously, in the same way that we do, then it would have a mind of its own, and would perceive the world just as we do",
